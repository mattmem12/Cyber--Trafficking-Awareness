        <h2>Overview of Victims in North America (2018)</h2>
        <p>
            The landscape of human trafficking in North America is complex, characterized by significant intraregional and transregional dynamics. 
            A striking feature of these trafficking flows is that a majority of detected victims in North America specifically the United States are citizens, highlighting the prevalence of domestic trafficking. 
            The data reveals that approximately 75% of victims are trafficked domestically, with only 7% crossing borders from other North American countries. 
            In comparison 9% of victims originate from Asia, while 3% come from both Central America and the Caribbean.

            This trend of increasing domestic trafficking is evident in UNODC data spanning 2014 to 2018. Domestic victims made up 47% of the total in 2014, rising significantly to 68% in 2016 and reaching 75% by 2018.
             Meanwhile, the proportion of cross-border victims from other North American countries dropped from 16% in 2014 to just 7% in 2018. 
             Similarly, victims originating from Central America and the Caribbean decreased from 12% to 3%, while those from Asia fell from 16% to 9%. 
            These shifting patterns highlight the urgent need for targeted intervention strategies to address the escalating issue of domestic trafficking.
